# Welcome to Shedrub.org

## Prerequisites

-   node >=10.0.0
-   npm >=6.9.0
-   yarn >=1.0.1

## Local Development

Clone repo

```sh
# git clone https://github.com/PrakashKumarBhandari/shedrub
```

Make sure you have `node` and `yarn` installed. Install packages.

Note: Use `yarn` instead of `npm` to generate only one lock file.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install or yarn install

# gulp
The default task will run a sequence of build, browser-sync, and watch, as you would usually do in gulp.

# serve with hot reload at localhost:4306
yarn start or npm start

# build
yarn build


```
